            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>While counting calories and exercising is still the best way to lose weight, it can be exhausting when done for the long term. When it comes to losing 10 pounds or more, I focus on the concept of nutrient-dense eating. This can help you lose weight without feeling deprived.</p>
            <p>Nutrient-dense eating, or as I like to call it, “the biggest bang for your calorie buck,” compares the quantity and quality of nutrients with the number of calories in an item.</p>
            <p>Simply stated, that means emphasizing foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and antioxidants — and also low in calories. Examples include fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grains.</p>
