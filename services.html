            <h3>One Month Diet Plan</h3>
            <p>Dive in and start hitting your weight-loss goals today with help from this simple 30-day meal plan featuring easy-to-make recipes and helpful meal-prep tips. You'll set yourself up for success to lose upwards of 8 pounds when following this meal plan for a full month. Each day comes in around 1,200 calories (a calorie level at which most people will lose a healthy 1 to 2 pounds per week) and includes enough protein and fiber that you'll feel full and satisfied while cutting calories.</p>
            <p>This plan is optimized to save you time and energy by reusing ingredients and leftovers in creative ways throughout the month, and weekly meal-prep steps show how a little legwork at the beginning of the week means less work during the busy weekdays. We call for healthy convenience items whenever possible, but scan the plan and see what else you can get from the store premade (like cooked brown rice, frozen riced cauliflower and spiralized zucchini noodles). By keeping this plan simple yet exciting and delicious, you'll be motivated to stick with it till the end.</p>
